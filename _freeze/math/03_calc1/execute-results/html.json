Many of us have made career choices to deliberately avoid having to deal with calculus. Still, calculus is important because for computational social science because, at its core, it is about dealing with continuity in a consistent manner. \n\nMore often than not we will deal with variables and distributions that are (at least assumed) continuous. Moreover, many single-number quantities of interest in data analysis, like p-values or standard errors, are calculated from continuous distributions (more about this in POLI SCI 403).\n\nDealing with continuity also means introducing new operations beyond the usual addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, hence the difficulty. We will take it slow and focus on one at a time. Today is all about derivatives.\n\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are about (instantaneous) rate of change.\n\n\nA helpful way to think about a derivatives is as a *slope*. Let's consider a linear function of the form $y = 2 x$:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # could also just do library(ggplot2)\nggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x){2 * x}, \n                xlim = c(-10, 10))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_calc1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can imagine any political variables in the x- and y-axes. What is the rate of change? In other words, what is the derivative? Remember that we can calculate the slope with\n\n$$\nm = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}\n$$\n\nwhich you can remember with the mnemonic \"rise over run.\"\n\nNow consider another slightly more complicated function, a quadratic one, $y = x^2$:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x){x ^ 2}, \n                xlim = c(-10, 10))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_calc1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat happens when we apply our slope function?\n\n<!-- See if they get it right away, otherwise do the exercise -->\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n<!-- #### Exercise -->\n\n<!-- 1)  Use the slope formula to calculate the rate of change between 5 and 6. -->\n\n<!-- 2)  Use the slope formula to calculate the rate of change between 5 and 5.5. -->\n\n<!-- 3)  Use the slope formula to calculate the rate of change between 5 and 5.1. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=true}\n## Answer\nHere the derivative depends on the value of $x$. It is actually $2x$.\n:::\n\nDifferential calculus is about finding these derivatives in a more straightforward manner. We can generalize our slope formula as\n\n$$\nm = \\frac{f(x_1+ \\Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\nThe point is that when $\\Delta x$ is arbitrarily small, we'll get our rate of change. Formalizing this:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{\\Delta x\\to0} \\frac{f(x_1+ \\Delta x) - f(x_1)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x) \n$$\n\nA few points on notation:\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$ is read \"The derivative of $f$ of $x$ with respect to $x$.\" One would be tempted to read $\\frac{d}{dx}$ as a fraction, but it is just here for notation.\n\nThe variable with respect to which we're differentiating is the one that appears in the bottom (in the case above, this is $x$).\n\n\n$f'(x)$ ($f$ prime $x$) is the derivative of $f(x)$. This is a more compact form to refer to derivatives when you have defined $f(x)$ elsewhere.\n\n### Rules of differentiation\n\nHow to compute derivatives? Sometimes you can try a bunch of numbers and get at the answer. Sometimes you can use the limit-based formula above, if you know a few properties of limits. But in most cases you will either use software (more on this later) or the **rules of differentiation**, which we will cover now.\n\n**Constant rule:** $(c)' = 0$.\n\nThere is no change in a constant:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x){2}, xlim = c(-10, 10))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_calc1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Coefficient rule:** $(c \\cdot f(x))' = c \\cdot f'(x)$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x){2 * x}, xlim = c(-10, 10), aes(color = \"y = 2x\")) +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x){4 * x}, xlim = c(-10, 10), aes(color = \"y = 4x\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(\"Function\", values = c(\"red\", \"blue\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03_calc1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Sum/difference rule:** $(f(x) \\pm g(x))' = f'(x) \\pm g'(x)$.\n\nThe two rules above give us that the derivative is a *linear operator*.\n\n\n**Power rule:** $(x^n)'=nx^{(n-1)}$\n\nRemember when we wanted to calculate the derivative of $y=x^2$ above? We can use the power rule, with $n=2$\n\n$$\nnx^{(n-1)} = 2x^{(2-1)}=2x\n$$\n\n$\\;nx^{(n-1)} = 2x^{(2-1)}=2x$. \n\nLet's try out $\\frac{d}{dx}4x^3$ and $\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 2x)$ on the board.\n\nHere are a few functions to practice the differentiation rules:\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Exercise\n\nUse the differentiation rules we have covered so far to calculate the derivatives of $y$ with respect to $x$ of the following functions:\n\n1)  $y= 4x^3$\n2)  $y= x^2 + 2x$\n3)  $y = 2x^2 + 10$\n4)  $y = 5x^4 - \\frac{2}{3}x^3$\n5)  $y = 9 \\sqrt x$\n6)  $y = \\frac{4}{x^2}$\n7)  $y = ax^3 + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n8)  $y = \\frac{2w}{5}$\n:::\n\n\n**Exponent and logarithm rules:**\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(c^x)' &= c^x \\cdot ln(c), & \\forall x>0 \\\\\n\\\\\n(log_a(x))' &= \\frac{1}{x \\cdot ln(a)}, & \\forall x>0  \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n[Euler's number](https://tinyurl.com/2j4a9ykc) ($e$) has interesting properties when it comes to derivatives.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(e^x)' &= e^x \\\\\n\\\\\n(ln(x))' &= \\frac{1}{x}, & \\forall x>0 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n<!-- #### Exercise -->\n\n<!-- Compute the following: -->\n\n<!-- 1)  $\\frac{d}{dx}(10e^x)$ -->\n<!-- 2)  $\\frac{d}{dx}(ln(x) - \\frac{e^2}{3})$ -->\n\n\nNow we'll get to a couple of more advanced (and powerful) rules.\n\n* **Product rule:** $(f(x)g(x))'=f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)$\n\n* **Quotient rule:** $\\displaystyle(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)})' = \\frac{f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$\n\n* **Chain rule:** $(f(g(x))' = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n\n<!-- > Let's calculate $\\frac{d}{dx}(3 \\cdot ln(x) \\cdot x^2)$ on the board. -->\n\n<!-- > Let's compute $\\frac{d}{dx}(e^{x^{2}})$ on the board. -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n<!-- #### Exercise -->\n\n<!-- Use the differentiation rules we have covered so far to calculate the derivatives of $y$ with respect to $x$ of the following functions: -->\n\n<!-- 1)  $x^3 \\cdot x$ -->\n<!-- 2)  $e^x \\cdot x^2$ -->\n<!-- 3)  $(3x^4-8)^2$ -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n### Higher-order derivatives\n\nWe saw call $f'(x)$ the first derivative, but we can also calculate higher-order derivatives. These are not common in social science data analysis, but they appear in game theory, complex systems, and agent-based modeling.\n\n<!-- This explanation is tricky. You may get it, but may not fully get it. Try to visualize in slides -->\nFor example, the second derivative tells us whether the slope of a function is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same at any point $x$ on the function's domain. For example, when driving a car:\n\n-   $f(x)$ = distance traveled at time $x$\n-   $f'(x)$ = speed at time $x$\n-   $f''(x)$ = acceleration at time $x$\n\nTo calculate higher-order derivatives, you just calculate the derivative using the usual differentiation rules, then calculate the derivative of the output, and so on for however many orders you have. In a college-level calculus course, these can get very crazy during your midterm. In practice, you will rarely lead anything beyond a second derivative.\n\nFor example, we can calculate the following second derivative:\n\n$$f''(x) = \\frac{d^2(x^4)}{dx^2}$$\n\nFirst, we take the first derivative\n$$f'(x)=4x^3$$\n\nThen we use that output to take the second derivative\n$$f''(x)=f'(4x^3)=12x^2$$\n\nWe can keep going... for example, the third derivative is $$f'''(x) = f'(12x^2) = 24x$$\n\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n<!-- #### Exercise -->\n\n<!-- Compute the following: -->\n\n<!-- 1)  $\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}(x^5)$ -->\n<!-- 2)  $f''(4x^{3/2})$ -->\n<!-- 3)  $f''(4 \\cdot ln(x))$ -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n### Partial derivatives\n\nSo far, we have worked with derivatives of functions with only one variable. What happens when we have more than one variable that is changing?\n\nSuppose we have a function $f$ of two (or more) variables and we want to determine the rate of change relative to one of the variables. For a function $f(x,z)$, we call this a *partial derivative*\n\n$$ \n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_x}f(x,z) = \\frac{\\partial_y}{\\partial_x} = \\partial_x f\n$$\n\nTo obtain a partial derivative, we treat all other variables as constants and take the derivative with respect to the variable of interest (here $x$). For example:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny = f(x,z) &= xz \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial_y}{\\partial_x} &= z\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nYou can try to do the same for $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial_y}{\\partial_z}?$ on your own\n\n<!-- Let's solve $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial (x^2y+xy^2-x)}{\\partial x}$ and $\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial (x^2y+xy^2-x)}{\\partial y}$ on the board. -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-tip -->\n<!-- #### Example -->\n\n<!-- Let's say that $y$ is how much I like a movie, $d$ is how many dogs a movie has, and $e$ is how many explosions a movie has.
