The purpose of Math Camp is to give you a chance to brush up on concepts and skills that underlie the practice of quantitative data analysis in the social sciences.\nOur schedule features math in the morning and statistical programming in the afternoon. During lunch, we will also have a chance to meet faculty and graduate students from the department and have more informal conversations about the role of methods training in graduate school.\n\n\n\n   September 16 – 20\n   9:00 AM – 4:00 PM\n   Scott Hall 212",
