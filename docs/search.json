Notation is useful to write about general concepts or ideas that apply to a broad range of settings. The downside is that notation makes things harder to read.\nThis section introduces common notation practices in the social sciences that will help you in both in methods courses and when reading/writing papers. Usage may vary across fields and over time, but becoming familiar with general uses may still help you understand the deviations.",
