The purpose of Math Camp is to give you a chance to brush up on concepts and skills that underlie the practice of quantitative data analysis in the social sciences.\nOur schedule features math in the morning and statistical programming in the afternoon. During lunch, we will also have a chance to meet faculty and graduate students and have more informal conversations about the role of methods training in graduate school.\n\n\n\n   September 16 – 20\n   9:00 AM – 4:00 PM\n   Scott Hall 212",

    "text": "1 Overview\nA great deal of quantitive empirical research in the social sciences and statistics textbooks use notation extensively. Notation is useful to write about general concepts or ideas that apply to a broad range of settings. The downside is that notation makes things harder to read.\nThis section introduces common notation practices in the social sciences that will help you in both in methods courses and when reading/writing papers. Usage may vary across fields and over time, but becoming familiar with general uses may still help you understand the deviations.\n\n\n2 Set Notation",
