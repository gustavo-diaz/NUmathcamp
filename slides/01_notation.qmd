# What is math camp?

## Math camp

. . .

- A (re)introduction to math topics necessary for the quantitative methods sequence

Goals:

::: incremental
- Get to know you and meet your methods training needs/goals
- Get to know your colleagues
:::


## Math camp

- A (re)introduction to math topics necessary for the quantitative methods sequence

Why a *math camp*?

::: incremental
- Can always use more methods training
- More of a *methods* camp
:::

## Who are you?



- Name
- Pronouns
- Discipline + intended subfield/research area
- A hobby or interesting fact about yourself

## What are we going to cover? {.smaller}

```{r schedule, include = FALSE}
schedule =
  tribble(
    ~Day, ~Date, ~Morning, ~Afternoon,
    1, "September 16", "Notation, sets, functions", "R and RStudio",
    2, "September 17", "Matrices", "Tidyverse I",
    3, "September 18", "Calculus I", "Tidyverse II",
    4, "September 19", "NO MEETING", NA,
    5, "September 20", "Calculus II", "Sampling and simulation"
)
```


```{r show-schedule, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
schedule %>% 
  tt() %>% 
  style_tt(
    i = 4,
    j = 3,
    colspan = 2,
    align = "l"
  )
```

. . .

- **Morning:** Math (9AM - noon) 

- **Lunch:** Meet faculty, students (noon - 1PM)

- **Break** (1-1:30PM)

- **Afternoon:** R programming (1:30-4PM)

- See [gustavodiaz.org/NUmathcamp](https://gustavodiaz.org/NUmathcamp/) for content

## Expectations

::: incremental
- You are not being evaluated
- No need to take extensive notes
- Bring a laptop
- Engage
- Get things wrong
- Ask
- Interrupt if you need to
:::

# Questions?

# Break

# Notation, Sets, Functions

## What is this?

::: incremental
- Symbols, letters, formulae used over plain language
- **Goal:** Talk about stuff in general terms
- **Downside:** Harder to follow
- **Conjecture:** Math is not hard, its *language* is
- **Solution:** Practice

## Set Notation

**Set:** A collection of elements

. . .

**Numerical sets**

::: incremental
- $\mathbb{N}$: Natural numbers &nbsp; $\{(0), 1, 2, 3\}$
- $\mathbb{Z}$: Integers &nbsp; $\{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$: Rational numbers &nbsp; $\{1/2, 3/2, 4\}$
- $\mathbb{R}$: Real numbers &nbsp; $\{-899.8, 22, 4.5, \sqrt{\pi}\}$
- $\mathbb{I}$: Imaginary numbers &nbsp; $ai | a \in \mathbb{R}; i= \sqrt{-1}$
- $\mathbb{C}$: Complex numbers &nbsp; $a + bi$
:::

## Measurement

::: incremental
- Sets can also have non-numerical elements
- We may code this as numbers or not, what matters is what we assume about the elements
- **Nominal:** No mathematical relationship between elements
- **Ordinal:** Order is meaningful
- **Interval:** Elements equidistant, but no meaningful zero
- **Ratio (interval-ratio)**: There is a meaningful zero
