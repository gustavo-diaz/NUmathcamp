library(tinytable)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.pos = "center", echo = FALSE, 
               message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

# What is math camp?

## Math camp

. . .

- A (re)introduction to math topics necessary for the quantitative methods sequence

Goals:

::: incremental
- Get to know you and meet your methods training needs/goals
- Get to know your colleagues
:::


## Math camp

- A (re)introduction to math topics necessary for the quantitative methods sequence

Why a *math camp*?

::: incremental
- Can always use more methods training
- More of a *methods* camp
:::

## Who are you?



- Name
- Pronouns
- Discipline + intended subfield/research area
- A hobby or interesting fact about yourself

## What are we going to cover? {.smaller}

```{r schedule, include = FALSE}
schedule =
  tribble(
    ~Day, ~Date, ~Morning, ~Afternoon,
    1, "September 16", "Notation, sets, functions", "R and RStudio",
    2, "September 17", "Matrices", "Tidyverse I",
    3, "September 18", "Calculus I", "Tidyverse II",
    4, "September 19", "NO MEETING", NA,
    5, "September 20", "Calculus II", "Sampling and simulation"
)
```


```{r show-schedule, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
schedule %>% 
  tt() %>% 
  style_tt(
    i = 4,
    j = 3,
    colspan = 2,
    align = "l"
  )
```

. . .

- **Morning:** Math (9AM - noon) 

- **Lunch:** Meet faculty, students (noon - 1PM)

- **Break** (1-1:30PM)

- **Afternoon:** R programming (1:30-4PM)

- See [gustavodiaz.org/NUmathcamp](https://gustavodiaz.org/NUmathcamp/) for content

## Expectations

::: incremental
- You are not being evaluated
- No need to take extensive notes
- Bring a laptop
- Engage
- Get things wrong
- Ask
- Interrupt if you need to
:::

# Questions?

# Break

# Notation, Sets, Functions

## What is this?

::: incremental
- Symbols, letters, formulae used over plain language
- **Goal:** Talk about stuff in general terms
- **Downside:** Harder to follow
- **Conjecture:** Math is not hard, its *language* is
- **Solution:** Practice
:::

## Set Notation

**Set:** A collection of elements

. . .

**Numerical sets**

::: incremental
- $\mathbb{N}$: Natural numbers &nbsp; $\{(0), 1, 2, 3\}$
- $\mathbb{Z}$: Integers &nbsp; $\{\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$: Rational numbers &nbsp; $\{1/2, 3/2, 4\}$
- $\mathbb{R}$: Real numbers &nbsp; $\{-899.8, 22, 4.5, \sqrt{\pi}\}$
- $\mathbb{I}$: Imaginary numbers &nbsp; $\{ai | a \in \mathbb{R}, i= \sqrt{-1}\}$
- $\mathbb{C}$: Complex numbers &nbsp; $a + bi$
:::

## Measurement

::: incremental
- Sets can also have non-numerical elements
- We may code this as numbers or not, what matters is what we assume about the elements
- **Nominal:** No mathematical relationship between elements
- **Ordinal:** Order is meaningful
- **Interval:** Elements equidistant, but no meaningful zero
- **Ratio (interval-ratio)**: There is a meaningful zero
:::

<!-- Ask/give examples -->

## Set notation

. . .

Operations *within* sets

::: incremental
- $\exists$  "there exists"
- $\forall$   "for all"
- $\exists$   "exists"; there is something true 
- $\in$   "in" or "element of"
- \|   Such that 
- $\notin$  excluding (element) 
- $\equiv$ equivalent
:::

## Set notation

Operations *between* sets

::: incremental
- $\subset$; $\subseteq$  Subset
- $\varnothing$  Empty set
- $\cap$  Intersection; AND
- $\cup$  Union; OR
- $\setminus$  Difference
:::

## Practice

::: incremental
- $\{x|x \in \mathbb{N}, x < 4\}$
- $\{x|x \in \mathbb{R}, x < 200\}$
- $\{ai | a \in \mathbb{R}, i= \sqrt{-1}\}$
- $A \cap B$
- $A \cup B$
- $\{4n \in \mathbb{N} | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$
:::

## Greek notation

. . .

![](img/greek.jpg)

## Notation chart

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Greek

- Letters like $\mu$ denote **parameters** or **quantities of interest**

- Markings like $\widehat{\mu}$ denotes our **estimate** of such parameters/quantities

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Latin

- Letters like $X$ denote **variables** in our data


- Markings like $\bar{X}$  denotes **calculations** from our data

:::

::::


::: {style="text-align: center"}

$X \rightarrow \bar{X} \rightarrow \widehat{\mu} \xrightarrow{\text{hopefully!}} \mu$
:::

## Logic

::: incremental
- **Sufficient:** Y is true *if* A and B are true
- **Necessary:** Y is true *if and only if* A and B are true
- **INUS:** Insufficient but Necessary part of an Unnecessary but Sufficient set of conditions *(component causes)*
- **SUIN:**  Sufficient but Unnecessary condition that is part of a condition set that is Insufficient but Necessary for the outcome *(precipitating causes)*
:::

## Logical operators in R {.smaller}

::: incremental
- `&` AND
- `|` OR
- `!` NOT
- `<` LESS THAN
- `<=` LEQ
- `>` GREATER THAN
- `>=` GEQ
- `==` EXACTLY EQUAL TO
- `!=` NOT EQUAL TO
- `%in%` IN THE SET
:::

## Practice

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x = 3
x != 5 & x != 4
```

&nbsp;

. . .



```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
3 > 4 | 15 == 12
```

&nbsp;

. . .

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
LETTERS == letters
```

&nbsp;

. . .

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
first_name = unlist(str_split("Gustavo", "")) 
first_name %in% letters
```
