# What is math camp?

## Math camp

. . .

- A (re)introduction to math topics necessary for the quantitative methods sequence

Goals:

::: incremental
- Get to know you and meet your methods training needs/goals
- Get to know your colleagues
:::


## Math camp

- A (re)introduction to math topics necessary for the quantitative methods sequence

Why a *math camp*?

::: incremental
- Can always use more methods training
- More of a *methods* camp
:::

## Who are you?



- Name
- Pronouns
- City or country you are/came from
- Discipline + intended subfield/research area
- A hobby or interesting fact about yourself

## What are we going to cover? {.smaller}

```{r schedule, include = FALSE}
schedule =
  tribble(
    ~Week, ~Date, ~Morning, ~Afternoon,
    1, "Wednesday, September 3", "Introduction", "R and RStudio",
    1, "Thursday, September 4", "Notation, sets, functions", "Tidyverse I",
    1, "Friday, September 5", "Matrices", "Tidyverse II",
    2, "Monday, September 8", "Calculus I", "NO MEETING",

```{r show-schedule, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}

    i = c(4, 6),
    j = 4,
    background = "lightgray"
  ) %>% 
  style_tt(i = 7,
           background = "lightgray")
```

## Daily schedule

- **Breakfast** (9 - 9:30AM)

- **Morning:** Math (9:30AM - noon)

## Learning goals

::: incremental

- Make you feel very stressed about things you are supposed to already know

- Me saying "I told you this was important" in five years

- Confront your fears about math early on

- So that you can do the cool things with confidence

- (The fear never goes away, but you learn to live with it)

:::



## Expectations

::: incremental
- You are not being evaluated
- No need to take extensive notes
- Bring a laptop
- Engage
- Get things wrong
- Ask
- Interrupt if you need to
:::

## Some notes

::: incremental
- Class is not graded, but you will get credit for attending (POLI_SCI 490)

- Content is cumulative (now and forever)

- Everyone comes in with different experiences and background. This is a feature, not a bug
:::

## Tips on being a grad student

::: incremental
- Read the material, learn to be strategic about it, come up with things to discuss

- People around you are colleagues, not competition. Treat everyone with respect (including yourself)

- Nobody knows what is going on, most people will help you figure things out

- There is life beyond grad school

# Questions?

# Break

# Getting in the mindset

## Why do I need mathcamp?

You are being trained to become a producer of **scientific knowledge**

. . . 

**Science:** Knowledge generation through falsification

. . . 

**Falsification:** Trying to prove *ourselves* wrong

## Scientific method

1. Puzzle/question

2. Theory/model

3. Hypothesis/implications

4. Observation/testing

5. Conclusion/evaluation

. . .

Your job will be to become good at *proposing* and *testing* **theories**

## What is a theory? {.center}

### ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I have no idea

::: {style="font-size: 40%;"}
and that's why you need a PhD to do it well
:::

:::

## But it sure is important!

. . .

Most common reasons why a peer-reviewed journal rejects an article:

::: incremental
1. Having no theory
2. Weak theory
3. Insufficient theoretical innovation
:::

. . .

If you ask me, theory is **logical explanation** or **informed speculation**

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
(but I am not the right person to ask)
:::

## The important part

::: incremental
- Cannot *test* theories because they **unambiguously true or false**

- Need to **believe** a theory is true to engage with it scientifically

- Instead, test **arguments** that follow from a theory (hypotheses/implications)
:::

. . .

Sounds like splitting hairs, but there is a good reason for this

## Example

:::

## Details

> In collaboration with Illinois-based Sounds Good Choir, the study assessed the feasibility of virtual group singing for adults over 55 — including those with neurocognitive disorders like dementia — during the COVID-19 pandemic when older adults were experiencing health declines due to isolation. It found virtual group singing can be an effective tool for promoting well-being and social connection during isolation.

:::

## Findings

> Participants in the group choir during the pandemic consistently described the activity as providing a sense of normalcy amid widespread disruption — a theme that emerged prominently and merits further investigation.

. . .

> This suggests that such interventions may help restore a feeling of normalcy, supporting psychological well-being and offering a means of reconnecting with a stable sense of self.

## Breaking it apart

. . .

**Question:** Can singing help overcome isolation?

. . .

**Theory:** Choral singing is a therapeutic activity for individuals with neurological disorders

. . .

**Hypothesis:** Individuals who sing in a choir will report higher levels of well-being than those who do not

. . .

**Test:** Organize virtual group choir, ask survey questions in the end

. . .

**Conclusion:** "Isolated older adults find joy and connection through virtual singing"

. . .

## Limitations?

. . .

**Ideal study**

. . .

Observe person $i$'s well-being with and without singing, everything else constant

. . .


**Actual study**

- Adults 55 an older in Chicago

- Elected to participate

- Two teleconferencing programs

- 176 survey responses out of 695 participants

## Problem

. . .

Cannot observe the ideal counterfactual

. . .

Any test/evidence can only be **suggestive**

. . .

- When evidence supports hypothesis, your theory is ~~accepted~~ **not rejected**

- When evidence does not support hypothesis, your theory is ~~rejected~~ **not accepted**

. . . 

Connecting from narrow findings to broad theories requires **assumptions**

## Statistics

Is all about acknowledging this gap and making assumptions *explicit, systematic, and credible*

::: incremental

- **Math** is a tool that helps us translate across domains

- The difficulty lies mostly in embracing the *abstraction*

- Less so on notation, symbols, operations

:::

## Frequently asked questions

. . .

Do I need mathcamp if...

::: incremental
- I already have training in quantitative methods?
- I plan to use qualitative methods only?
- I am in political theory?
- I want a teaching job?
- I am considering non-academic jobs?
