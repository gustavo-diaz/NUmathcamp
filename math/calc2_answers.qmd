Just showing the indefinite integrals since the final step is trivial.

1.  $\displaystyle\int x^2 dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C$

2.  $\displaystyle\int 3x^2dx = x^3 + C$

3.  $\displaystyle\int xdx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C$

4.  $\displaystyle\int 3x^2 + 2x - 7dx = x^3 + x^2 - 7x + C$

Things to remember:

- Insist on including the constant $C$ on the first example to show how they cancel out, then ignore it
- When computing the final definite integral, remember that continuous functions do not have density at discrete points. Important intuition for later!
